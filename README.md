# Taking notes

Hey, welcome!

I constanly had this feeling of studying too much and always forgetting about everything that I saw.
To try to address this issue, I started using Notion to keep track of topics I was taking a look and learning.

However, recently, I fell in love with Neovim. And I'm having hard times getting used to type on Notion Desktop nowadays.
It's not rare the moments where I type "w" to skip to the next word or a lot of "jjj" to go down a couple of lines.

So, I decided to move all my notes about studying (and who knows in the future, about everything), to a git repository, this one!

Probably everything that you are going to find here, will make no sense, and will matter only to me. But I'll let this repo public anyway, as a draft-ish digital garden.

If you want to contribute, feel free to open a PR. I'll be glad to share knowledge with you.
